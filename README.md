# Bear Notes App Exporter and Sync

This script will export new files from the SQLite database where Bear stores all notes. It assumes that every note has exactly one tag and uses that as the filepath in the exported files.

It will additionally sync files that already exist in the database, taking either the exported or the database version depending on the date they were last modified.

It will NOT import new files into the database -- please use Bear's built-in import function for this. Once the file has been imported it can be synced as normal.

## Installation
This script needs Python to run. I've only tested it on Python 3, but it may work with Python 2 as well.

1. Install Python requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements`.
2. Update the username and sync location in `main.py` to be what you want.
3. Update the path to `main.py` in the `.plist` file. By default, it is assumed that this is `~/Applications/bear-sync/main.py`.
4. Copy the `.plist` to the correct location: `cp com.gautampk.bear-sync.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.
5. Either logout and login to start the service, or run `launchctl start com.gautampk.bear-sync`.
